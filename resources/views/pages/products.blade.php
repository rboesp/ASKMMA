                                    Medicare Advantage is a type of Medicare health plan offered by a private company
                                    that contracts with Medicare to provide all Part A and Part B benefits. Medicare
                                    Advantage Plans include Health Maintenance Organizations, Preferred Provider
                                    Organizations, Private Fee-for-Service Plans, Special Needs Plans, and Medicare
                                    Medical Savings Account Plans. If you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan,
                                    your Medicare services are covered through that plan, and are not paid for under
                                    Original Medicare. Most Medicare Advantage Plans offer prescription drug
                                    coverage.

                        <p class="mt-4">
                            Medicare Advantage Plans, sometimes called "Part C" or "MA Plans," are offered by private
                            companies approved by Medicare. If you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you still have
                            Medicare,
                            however your Medicare Part A (Hospital Insurance) and Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance)
                            coverage come from the Medicare Advantage Plan and not Original Medicare.

                                    A Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) policy is sold by a private company,
                                    and can help pay certain health care costs that Original Medicare does not cover
                                    (co-payments, co-insurance, and deductibles).

                                    have Original Medicare and you buy a Medigap policy, Medicare will pay its share
                                    of the Medicare-approved amount for covered health care costs, and your Medigap
                                    policy pays its share.

                                    per day, per week, per month, per visit or per event, depending on the plan and the
                                    benefit that applies. HIP policies are standalone, which means they do not coordinate
                                    with your other health insurance coverage.

                                    This is the type of coverage that will pay the full life insurance benefit starting
                                    immediately upon approval.

                            Graded Benefit: <br>
                            "Graded benefit" means there were some concerns with the health interview over pre-existing
                            conditions, and that the life insurance benefit will pay out on a reduced basis the first 2
                            years. For example, if you have a $10,000 final expense policy approved, many companies will
                            pay out 30% of the 10,000 if you die in year one, 70% in year two and 100% in year three.
                            Different companies have different payout schedules, so it’s important to fully understand
                            before making any purchase decisions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-4">
                            Both types of plans listed above offer up to $25,000 in final expense coverage. Some final
                            expense companies have age restrictions that would reduce the total amount you can apply
                            for. For example, many companies will not allow graded benefits to exceed $15,000 for
                            applicants over the age of 70. So, it’s important to have detailed discussions with your
                            final expense agent or final expense company representative.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-4">
                            The average cost of a final expense policy depending on your age is around $40-$50 per month
                            for roughly $10,000-$12,000 in coverage. Due to the low monthly premiums, some people often
                            refer to final expense as “affordable end-of-life insurance”.

                                    Life insurance is a contract to provide a measure of financial security for your family
                                    after you die. The three main components of the life insurance contract are a death
                                    benefit, a premium payment and, in the case of permanent life insurance, a cash value
                                    account. You pay now so after your death, your dependents can continue with their lives
                                    comfortably without the burden of the loss of household income. When purchasing a life
                                    insurance policy, consider your financial situation and the standard of living you want
                                    to maintain for your dependents or survivors.

                            your family have to relocate? Will there be adequate funds for future or ongoing expenses
                            such as daycare, mortgage payments and college? It is prudent to re-evaluate your life

                            divorce, the birth or adoption of a child, or purchase of a major item such as a house or

                                    Cancer Insurance is an insurance policy that pays only after cancer is diagnosed. Cancer
                                    insurance is supplemental insurance, and most types pay policyholders a lump sum upon
                                    diagnosis with a covered cancer, while others offer supplemental payments for
                                    healthcare costs.

                                    Many cancer insurance policies provide a one-time payment, up to the policy limits, upon
                                    cancer diagnosis. Typically, this money can be used for whatever the policyholder
                                    chooses, whether for travel expenses (such as for traveling to a specialist or cancer
                                    center), co-payments, experimental treatments, or living expenses.

                            These payments follow a schedule listed with the policy, rather than paying in one go. It
                            does not pay a percent of your bill; it pays a certain dollar amount for each covered
                            category such as radiation treatment, x-rays, surgery, or hospice care. The expenses paid by
                            a cancer insurance policy depend on the terms of the policy, which should be reviewed
                            carefully before purchasing a policy.
